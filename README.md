============


**[GEOGLAM RAPP](https://map.geo-rapp.org/) no longer uses code in this repo. It is developed in 
[simple-saas-terria-map](https://github.com/TerriaJS/simple-saas-terria-map), configured in 
[saas-catalogs-public](https://github.com/TerriaJS/saas-catalogs-public/tree/main/geo-rapp) and released from

[GEOGLAM RAPP](https://map.geo-rapp.org/) is a website for map-based access to information about the state and condition of global 
rangelands. It provides time-based data on the resources used by livestock, allowing country and regional tracking of livestock production including production of meat, wool, and milk.

The main datasets are:
* Rangeland and pasture cover
* Plant available water content

Ancilliary datasets include:
* Environmental: rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture
* Livestock use: biomass use, production, feed efficiency, excretion, and greenhouse gas emissions

GEOGLAM RAPP is based on Data61's Open Source TerriaJS web geospatial platform: https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs
